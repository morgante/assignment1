----
1. [0 points] Get your programming environment set up; I assume that since you all have prior programming experience that this will not be a difficult task. - **Asyrique**
2. [10 points] Create a workflow diagram (use whatever format helps you understand the process - flowcharts work well for this sort of task) of how a license application flows through the system, with optional branches into license translation and eye testing. One branch should terminate in permanent failure if any of the required documents not available at the DLD (driverâ€™s license, passport, Emirates ID) is missing, expired, or inconsistent with other documents. - **Morgante**
3. [30 points] Create a complete module dependency diagram (MDD) of your design for this overall system, and provide a separate document detailing design choices (where you used what object-oriented strategy, design pattern, or concurrent approach and why) - **Asyrique**
4. [30 points] Create a complete finite state machine (FSM) of the system assuming one agent in each queue (that is, non-concurrent). Describe what conceptual complexities arise when you add multiple agents (i.e. concurrency) to the situation. - **Asyrique**
5. [30 points] Create a working implementation of your MDD and FSM in Java or Python. Print to console liberally to display the motion of customers/applications through the system. - **Morgante** & **Asyrique**
